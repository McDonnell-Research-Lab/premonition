    "### About This Python Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- This notebook demonstrates the steps in Premonition between the initial step of providing a realm name, up until the createion of prompts to be passed to Stable Diffusion, for synthetic image generation for the Realm.\n",
    "- We need to use a Realm name to prompt GPT-4 to generate lists of classes, descriptions and Stable Diffusion prompts .\n",
    "- We use 6 example Realms, each of which is defined by a short phrase or single word:\n",
    "    1. \"Items near roads\"\n",
    "    2. \"Domestic furniture\"\n",
    "    3. \"Plants\"\n",
    "    4. \"Insects\"\n",
    "    5. \"Birds\"\n",
    "    6. \"Food\"\n",
    "- We have two separate kinds of Realm: (i) those based on biology, like \"Birds\", and (ii) more general concepts.\n",
    "- This is because for fine grained biological classification, we want diversity of species. For more more general concept, we ask the LLM to more generally list types/kinds/example of subtypes within the realm. \n",
    "- In order to ensure LLM outputs are easily parsed, we use few-shot prompt engineering, where we provide some exemplars.\n",
    "- We also prompt the LLM to provide formatted outputs, namely csv formatted."
